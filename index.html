        <p>Five blue, icy snowflakes<br>as pretty as a picture,<br>quietly floating through the chilly air.<br>Winter is here.<br><br>Four happy, white snowmen<br>as jolly as elves,<br>loudly laughing on the crunchy snow.<br>Winter is here.<br><br>Three frozen, beautiful icicles<br>as sharp as knives,<br>carefully hanging from wooden rooftops.<br>Winter is here.<br><br>Two calm, brown robins<br>as quiet as a mouse,<br>restfully perching on a glittering branch.<br>Winter is here.<br><br>One huge, bare tree<br>as still as a statue,<br>unexpectedly moving in the bitter wind.<br>Winter is here.<br><br>By Amelie</p>
